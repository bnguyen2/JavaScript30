    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let bao = 'bao';
    let bao2 = bao;
    bao = 'iscool'
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // let players2 = players;
    // players[3] = 'bao';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let players3 = players.slice();
    // players[3] = 'bao';

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let players4 = [].concat(players);
    // players[3] = 'bao'

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let players5 = [...players];
    players[3] = 'bao'
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = { ...person };
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: "wes",
